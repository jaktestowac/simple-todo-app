### Frontend Web Interface

This project includes a simple web frontend for managing your todos. After starting the server, open [http://localhost:3013](http://localhost:3013) in your browser to use the Todo App.

The frontend is served from the `public/` directory and interacts with the REST API described above.

## Additional Notes & Recommendations

- This API uses in-memory storage, so data will be lost when the server restarts.
- For production use, consider implementing persistent storage (database).
- The API is designed for development and testing purposes.

### Scripts

- `npm start` - Start the server using tsx
